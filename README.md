I’m **Saurabh Biswas**. I’m originally from India, currently living in **Omaha**, USA since 2012. I’m an IT professional and most of my work experience is on **Mainframe Technologies**.

I work for a large **Credit Card Processing Company**. We process a majority of the credit and debit card transactions happening in the USA. In my day to day life, I deal with a large volume of data that is required to successfully process card-based transactions. In recent years, I have noticed the demand of real-time processing data has grown up significantly. Banks want to use this data to carry out analytics on shopping trends, customer behavior etc.

Identifying real-time fraud is one of the key criteria of processing credit card transactions. I noticed that banks are leaning towards Machine Learning based fraud detection from traditional rule-based fraud detection systems.

These two things made me interested to know more about data analytics and machine learning. I enrolled into MS in Data Science program to learn about different data analytics techniques and Machine learning so that I can contribute to the latest trends.
