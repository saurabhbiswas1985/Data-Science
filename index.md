## Data Science Portfolio - Saurabh Biswas

I'm **Saurabh Biswas**. I'm originally from India, currently living in **Omaha, USA** since 2012. I'm an **IT professional** and most of my work experience is on **Mainframe Technologies**. 

I work for large **Credit Card Processing Company**. We process a majority of the credit and debit card transactions happening in the USA. In my day to day life, I deal with a large volume of data that is required to successfully process card-based transactions. In recent years, I have noticed the demand of real-time processing data has grown up significantly. Banks want to use this data to carry out analytics on shopping trends, customer behavior etc. 

Identifying real-time fraud is one of the key criteria of processing credit card transactions. I noticed that banks are leaning towards Machine Learning based fraud detection from traditional rule-based fraud detection systems. 

These two things made me interested to know more about data analytics and machine learning. I enrolled into MS in Data Science program to learn about different data analytics techniques and Machine learning so that I can contribute to the latest trends. 


### Projects

[Project 1 - Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Leraning](https://github.com/saurabhbiswas1985/Data-Science/tree/main/Credit%20Card%20Fraud%20Detection%20Using%20Machine%20Leraning) : Fraudulent Credit Card transactions are one of the **major sources of revenue loss** for credit card processing companies and financial institution. **Detecting & preventing fraudulent** transaction from occurring will reduce the revenue loss for financial institutions and increase in customer satisfaction. The aim of this project is to build an effective **classification model** that will predict fraudulent transactions

[Project 2 - Breast Cancer Prediction](https://github.com/saurabhbiswas1985/Data-Science/tree/main/Breast%20Cancer%20Prediction) : Breast Cancer is **second most common cancer** in women. With early diagnosis of breast cancer, patients can be isolated for early treatment for a better chance of survival. The aim of this project is to build a **classification model to predict breast cancer** based on FNA diagnosis label.

[Project 3 - Flu Mortality Impact Analysis](https://github.com/saurabhbiswas1985/Data-Science/tree/main/Flu%20Mortality%20Impact%20Analysis) : Each year lot of people dies because of influenza aka flu in United States of America. Few months of the year, the impact of flu is much more than the other months. This project will carry out a detail analysis based on data provided by CDC, [data.gov](http://www.data.gov/), [datausa.io](http://www.datausa.io/), [50 sates](http://50states.com).

[Project 4 - Airline Safety Analysis](https://github.com/saurabhbiswas1985/Data-Science/tree/main/Airline%20Safety%20Analysis) : Due to media propaganda, it is often thought airline travel is one of the risky modes of travel. The aim of this project to carry out detail analysis with visualization on airline travel v/s travel by car, rail and conclude.

[Project 5 - Stroke Prediction by Machine Learning](https://github.com/saurabhbiswas1985/Data-Science/tree/main/Stroke%20Prediction%20by%20Machine%20Learning) : Stroke is one leading cause of death in the world. There are several factors that increase the chances of stroke. The aim of this project is to analyze factors like BMI, age, gender, smoking habit, hypertension etc. and build a predictive model.

[Project 6 - Housing Price Prediction](https://github.com/saurabhbiswas1985/Data-Science/tree/main/Housing%20Price%20Prediction) : In recent Housing Price is trending upwards. It would be nice for potential buyers and sellers, if housing prices can be guessed based on features using Machine Learning. This project aims to build a regression model that will predict housing price accurately.

[Project 7 - Automobile Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/saurabhbiswas1985/Data-Science/tree/main/Automobile%20Customer%20Segmentation) : This project aims to divide the automobile market into 5 groups. This will help a new automobile company to launch and campaign their product targeting various groups.

[Project 8 - Twitter Sentiment Analysis - US Airlines](https://github.com/saurabhbiswas1985/Data-Science/tree/main/Twitter%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20-%20US%20Airlines) : This project will perform sentimental analysis on twitter data available on major US airlines.

[Project 9 - Telecom Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/saurabhbiswas1985/Data-Science/tree/main/Telecom%20Customer%20Churn%20Prediction) : This project will predict telecom customer churn. This will help telecom companies to address existing customers issue and retain them.

[Project 10 - Amazon Product Review Analysis](https://github.com/saurabhbiswas1985/Data-Science/tree/main/Amazon%20Product%20Review%20Analysis) : This project will analyze product reviews from amazon.
